# üè® Airbnb-Database

## Description

Here I will use MySQL to turn raw data into useful information for Airbnb property purchasers, then we will create and display a mock Airbnb database. Webpage is built using HTML and CSS. Queries and database is built using MySQL workbench. Machine learning model and visualizations use Python code. The SKlearn library allows us to create the machine learning analysis, Pandas helps manage the dataframe and Matplotlib allows us to create the visualizations. You can access this project on my website or at the link in the "About" section of this page.
